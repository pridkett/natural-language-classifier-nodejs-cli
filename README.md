# Natural Language Classifier tutorial 
This tutorial guides you through the process of creating and setting up a classifier by using a Node.js wrapper command-line interface for the IBM Watson&trade; Natural Language Classifier service. This tutorial teaches you how to create, train, and use a classifier.

In this tutorial, you train a classifier that can interpret a weather-related question and return either "temperature" or "condition." For example, for the question, "Is it windy," the system returns "conditions".  For the question, "Is it hot outside," the service returns "temperature".

## Stage 1: Obtain your service credentials
Before you can work with a service in Bluemix, you must obtain your service credentials. If you already have your credentials for the Natural Language Classifier service, you can skip this step.

The following steps obtain the service credentials by creating a web application in Node.js for the Natural Language Classifier service. You are completing these steps only to obtain your service credentials for Bluemix.

1. Log in to Bluemix:
	1. Click **LOG IN** in the upper right corner of the page at <a target="_blank" href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net">console.ng.bluemix.net</a>.
	2. Enter your Bluemix ID and password on the authentication page.
2. Create an app:
	1. Click **Create an app**.
	2. Select **Web**.
	3. Select the starter **SDK for Node.js**, and click **Continue**.
	4. Type a unique name for your app, for example, `TutorialClassifier-<username>`, and click **Finish**.
	5. Select **CF Command Line Interface**.
	6. Click **View App Overview**.
3. Add the Natural Language Classifier service to your app:
	1. Click **Add a service or API** on the app **Overview** page.
	2. In the Bluemix **Catalog**, select the Natural Language Classifier service. The service is in the Bluemix Labs section of IBM Bluemix. Click **Bluemix Labs Catalog** at the bottom of the page.
	3. In the **Service name** field, type a unique name for the service instance, for example `Classifier-tutorial-<username>`, and click **Create**.
	4. The **Restage Application** window is displayed. Click **Restage** to restage your app.
3. Copy your credentials:
	1. In the tile for the Natural Language Classifier service, select the **Show Credentials** link to view your Bluemix credentials.
	2. Copy `username` and `password` from these service credentials.


***

## Stage 2: Configure the code to connect to your service
Download the tutorial code and configure it. Install the node.js client.

1. Set up your environment:
	1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-classifier-nodejs-cli/archive/master.zip) file that contains the source code from this project.
	2. Extract the package to a new directory.

2. Change to the new directory that contains this tutorial, for example:

	```sh
	$ cd natural-language-classifier-nodejs-cli-master
	```

3. Modify the tutorial to use your service credentials:
	1. Open the `creds.js` file with a text editor.
	2. Paste your username and password from the service credentials from Stage 1. For example:

		```js
		var natural_language_classifier = watson.natural_language_classifier({
			username: '<username>',
			password: '<password>',
			version: 'v1'
		});
		```

	3. Save the `creds.js` file.

4. Install the Natural Language Classifier CLI package by running the following command. The package includes all the commands that you need to work with a classifier from the command line:

	```node
	$ npm install
	```

***

## Stage 3: Create and train a classifier
The classifier learns from examples before it can return information for texts that it hasn't seen before. The example data is referred to as "training data." Training data is a set of text and one or more class identifiers. You upload the training data when you create a classifier.

To speed up this step, the `train.json` file is included as training data. The file is already formatted to work with the Natural Language Classifier service.

1. Run the following command to post the data and create the classifier.

	```node
	$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js create -f resources/weather_data_train.json
	```

	The response includes the classifier ID and status. You need the value of the `classifier_id` for the following stages. For example: 

	```JSON
	{
		"classifiers": [ 
			{
				"classifier_id": "10D41B-nlc-1",
				"url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier-experimental/api/v1/classifiers/10D41B-nlc-1"
			} 
		]
	}
	```

	**Tip**: To retrieve the IDs for all your classifiers, run `$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js list`. For a list of available commands, run `$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js --help`.

***

## Stage 4: Monitor the training status of the classifier

The new classifier must finish training and return the status of `Available` before you can work with it.

1. Run the following command to retrieve the status of classifier that you created in the previous stage. Replace `<classifier_id>` with the ID of your classifier:

	```node
	$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js status -c <classifier_id>
	```

2. Run this command until the status changes to `Available`. In this case, training takes about 6 minutes. If you see another status, look at the response to help identify the possible cause or issue.

***

## Stage 5: Use the classifier

Now that the classifier is trained, you can query it.

1. Run the following command for some weather-related questions to review how your classifier responds. Use the same classifier ID that you used in the previous stage. You can use a question from the `weather_data_test.txt` file in the `resources` directory, or provide your own weather-related questions:

	```node
	$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js classify -c <classifier_id> -t "How hot will it be today?"
	```

	The API returns a response that includes the name of class for which the classifier has the highest confidence. Other class-confidence pairs are listed in descending order of confidence:

	```JSON
	{
    	"classifier_id": "10D41B-nlc-1",
    	"url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier-experimental/api/v1",
    	"text": "How hot will it be today?",
    	"top_class": "temperature",
    	"classes": [
        	{
            	"class_name": "temperature",
            	"confidence": 0.9998201258549781
        	},
        	{
            	"class_name": "conditions",
            	"confidence": 0.00017987414502176904
        	}
    	]
	}
	```

2. Review the top class for the questions to see how the classifier is predicting them.

***

## Stage 6: Run a ground truth test against the classifier
Typically when building a machine learning model you'll want to run a test against the model to get an idea of its
overall performance. This system support running a test, sometimes called a blind test, against the classifier and
outputting the results as either a JSON or CSV file.

1. Create a new set of test data. This should be a file in the same format as the training data that you used in stage
3, above. However, this should be a new set of text and classes as feeding the data back in will likely result in
perfect accuract.

2. Run the following command:

    ```node
    $ node natural-langauge-classifier-cli.js blind -c <classifier_id> -f resources/weather_data_blind.json -x blindtest.csv -j blindtext.json 
    ```

3. This will output a single line of text on the command line that says the accuracy of the model. In this case the
accuracy is measured as the percentage of text for which the top match from the classifier was one of the classes
attached to the text. For example, if a text that was mapped against three classes, A, B, and C and came back with
a top match of B woudl be considered to be an exact match.

4. If the optional `-x` or `-j` arguments are provided a CSV and JSON file will be written. The CSV file has the following
columns:

  * **text**: the text passed into the classifier for classification
  * **top_class**: the best class as returned by the classifier
  * **exact_match**: 1 if the top class was also in the classes used in the blind data, 0 otherwise
  * **top_3**: 1 if the any of the top three classes returned by the classifier was in the blind data, 0 otherwise
  * **top_5**: 1 if the any of the top five classes returned by the classifier was in the blind data, 0 otherwise
  * **match_fail**: 1 if none of the top ten classes returned by the classifier were in the blind data, 0 otherwise
  
The JSON data contains all the same information but also contains more raw information about the confidence of each
text passed to the classifier and can be used for more advanced analytics and reports.

***

## Stage 7: Delete the tutorial classifier
You successfully completed the process of training and querying a classifier in the Natural Language Classifier service.

So that you can create classifiers for your own use and with your own ground truth, you might want to delete this classifier from the tutorial. To delete the classifier that you created in this tutorial, call the `DELETE v1/classifiers/{classifier_id}` method:

* Run the `delete` command to delete the classifier. Include the `classifier_id` for the classifier you want to delete.  For example:

	```node
	$ node natural-language-classifier-cli.js delete -c 10D41B-nlc-1
	```

	If the classifier is deleted, the response is an HTTP 200 code.
